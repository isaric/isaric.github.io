    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>&gt; since April 2021 : Path Variable LLC</p>
    <p class="indent">After more than 5 years as a salaried employee, I opened my one-man company to move into the world of contracting.
    The company offers my consulting, architecture and development services. Full-time, long-term contracts are preferred. I can cover
    almost the full stack from the infrastructure layer and networking on through to the application layer. I'm not a frontend expert by
    any means, but I was able to cobble together this site.
    </p>
    <p>&gt; October 2020 - April 2021 : Infobip d.o.o.</p>
    <p class="indent">Looking for a change of domain after working a long time on e-commerce projects, I applied for a position at
      Infobip. They offered me a job as a Senior Software Engineer, working on one of their core microservices for processing incoming
      and outgoing messages. The tech stack used was primarily Java with an administrative frontend written in React.js.
      I also contributed to their DevOps procedures aside from the regular work I did as part of a dev team. While it was impressive
      to see such a large deployment landscape in action and continuously deploying, I felt constrained by the rules and procedures in a
      large corporation. Feeling that I have acquired enough experience and proven myself, I decided to leave and enter the
      contracting world.
    </p>
    <p>&gt; May 2018 - September 2021 : Digacon Software Solutions d.o.o.</p>
    <p class="indent"> Digacon is an agency focused on e-commerce projects primarily with heavy involvement with SAP-based projects.
      The stack is also Java with a preference towards Gradle as the build system. In addition to working for clients that included the likes
      of the swiss auto giant AMAG and the worldwide e-commerce platform Distrelec, I also contributed to the companies common
      libraries and wrote Gradle plugins for easier development and deployment of new projects.
    </p>
    <p>&gt; December 2017 - May 2018: Rinels d.o.o. </p>
    <p class="indent">Looking to move towards remote work I took a job at Rinels. They were my first fully remote employer.
      I immediately grew to love such a lifestyle and managing my own time was never a problem for me. Rinels was building
      their own product - a medical CRM system that catered towards small to midsize clinics. The stack was primarily Java and
      the Eclipse Scout framework. I wrote some satellite services using Spring that provided some additional functionalities.
    </p>
    <div id="ski"></div>
    <p>&gt; May 2016 - December 2017: Ecx.io - An IBM Company </p>
    <p class="indent">Ecx.io was my first serious internationally-based employer with offices in Austria, Croatia, Germany
    and the UK. It was here that I was introduced to the SAP Hybris framework that would be the focus of the initial part of my
    career. Ecx.io was an agency and it followed Agile principles when organizing projects. My biggest project with them was
    for the Heineken Corporation - a wholesale order and delivery system. I also worked for clients such as Doka and Schluter
    Systems.

  <div class="education">
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>&gt; 2010 - 2011 : Master of Arts in Political Science from Central European University</p>
    <p class="indent"> Then still located in Budapest, Hungary, CEU provided an amazing environment to study with some of the worlds best scholars
      and motivated students from across the globe. Studying in CEU demanded a strong focus but at the same time so much care was taken to give the students
      the best tools to handle their tasks. I focused on Political Economy, studying the former Yugoslav states and their environments for
      my master's thesis. With graduation nearing, I started to practice coding while looking towards the tech sector as the place to start my new career.</p>

    <p>&gt; 2006 -2010 : Bachelors degree in Political Science from the University Of Zagreb</p>
    <p class="indent">Leaving high school with a new focus on social sciences, I opted to enroll in the study of Political Science.
      Again, it followed a broad curriculum that covered areas such as sociology, research methodology, philosophy, history, economics
      and ideology. Political science as a field is excellent in fostering an interdisciplinary mindset since it unabashedly borrows
      methods and studies from other fields. This is not something it hides, but rather displays with pride.</p>

    <div id="certs"></div>
    <p>&gt; 2002 - 2006 : Mathematics and Natural Sciences Gymnasium Lucijan Vranjanin, Zagreb, Croatia</p>
    <p class="indent">Akin to a US magnet school, the Gymnasium had a broad curriculum with a hard focus on maths. My senior
    year we learned the basics in areas such as combinatorics, derivatives and integrals. Combinatorics was my favorite because
    the examples included card games and russian roulette. Joking aside, interesting applications are what get people into dense
    theoretical subjects.</p>
